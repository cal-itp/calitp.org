        <p>
          We collaborate with the California Department of Technology (CDT) to provide transit riders with a seamless way to
          qualify for and enroll in transit benefits online.
        </p>
        <quote>QUOTE</quote>
        <p>Together, we aim to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expand Cal-ITP Benefits, our web application that uses Login.gov and the California Identity Gateway to safely and
            securely provide digital eligibility checks for transit benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transit riders who are older adults and U.S. Veterans can use the service today. Support eligibility checks for
            CalFresh cardholders, Medicare cardholders, and people with disabilities in the coming year.
          </li>
          <li>Promote the use of a Digital ID system that can be used across state departments. </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrate how we can deliver dependable and equitable public services while reducing the need for outdated
            paper-based processes. 
          </li>
