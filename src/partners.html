        for and enroll in transit benefits online.

      <p>Together, we aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Expand Cal-ITP Benefits, our web application that uses Login.gov and the California Identity Gateway to safely and
          securely provide digital eligibility checks for transit benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transit riders who are older adults and U.S. Veterans can use the service today. Support eligibility checks for CalFresh
          cardholders, Medicare cardholders, and people with disabilities in the coming year.
        </li>
        <li>Promote the use of a Digital ID system that can be used across state departments. </li>
        <li>
          Demonstrate how we can deliver dependable and equitable public services while reducing the need for outdated paper-based
          processes. 
        </li>
