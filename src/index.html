    <h2>Bringing industry standards to California’s transit providers</h2>
    <p>
      There are hundreds of public transit providers in California—with no consistent way to collect fares, verify
      eligibility for fare discounts, or provide real-time vehicle information to customers on their phones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of a consistent experience creates barriers for new customers, complicates travel across different systems, and increases expenses
      for individual providers.

    <p>This initiative is critical now more than ever.</p>
    <p>
      As COVID-19 hit the United States, many transit providers saw ridership decrease. But many who depend on transit do not have
      the privilege to work from home—including many essential workers. Reliable transit access and contactless payments are
      critical components to ensuring that transit forms a key part of the COVID-19 crisis response and recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cal-ITP also supports the state’s longer-term equity, economic development, and climate goals as delineated in
      <a

        >2020 California Executive Order N-79-20</a
      >. Increased transit ridership is a key component of California’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat
      climate change. To reach its full potential, Cal-ITP will provide individual transit providers with the buying power to save
      on the equipment needed to ensure that transit remains a core tenet of the state’s mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As California faces these unprecedented challenges, there is a sense of urgency around creating a seamless, simpler, and
      more sustainable transit experience in California. Collaboration and collective problem-solving are needed at all levels of
      government, public and private transit providers, academia, and think tanks, as well as vendors of relevant technologies and
      business models. Join us.
