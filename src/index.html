    <h2>Bringing industry standards to California’s transit providers</h2>
    <p>
      There are hundreds of public transit providers in California—with no single system for collecting fares, verifying
      eligibility for fare discounts, or providing up-to-date vehicle arrival information to riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lack of uniformity creates barriers for new riders, complicates travel across different systems, and increases expenses
      for individual providers.

        <h3>Increase transit ridership</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Contactless payments are an incentive for riders to return to transit after the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong>
          According to Visa,

          <strong>Convenient, universal fare payments grow ridership.</strong> Riders are more likely to use transit when they
          don’t need to think about how they’ll pay their fare. In its first year accepting contactless payments,

        <h3>Lower costs for transit providers and riders</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Cash alternatives will cut costs for transit providers.</strong> Washington, D.C., spends 10¢ per dollar
          collecting cash fares but

          (5.0%). However, given our state’s density, diversity, congestion, and size, travel by bus and rail can and should be
          higher in California. Contactless fare payments and real-time arrival information lead to higher transit ridership,
          mitigating congestion and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

            >A statewide program to verify eligibility for reduced fares will alleviate cumbersome processes for both transit
            providers and riders.</strong
          >
          A simple, digitized, statewide verification program will enable any rider to have their eligibility for a reduced-fare
          program instantly verified for any transit provider in California. This way, older adults, students, veterans, and
          others can ride transit anywhere in the state with the confidence that they’ll be charged the right fare every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fare capping reduces transit costs for low-income riders.</strong> Unlimited-ride passes cost more upfront,
          forcing many riders to pay as they go at full fare. Contactless fare collection enables “fare capping,” which allows
          riders to pay the unlimited-ride price over time. This means that, after tapping enough times to reach the cost of a
          daily, weekly, or monthly pass, riders will no longer be charged for transit use for the remainder of that time period.

    <p>This initiative is critical now more than ever.</p>
    <p>
      As COVID-19 hit the United States, many transit providers saw ridership decrease. But many who depend on transit do not have
      the privilege to work from home—including many essential workers. Reliable transit access and contactless payments are
      critical components to ensuring that transit forms a key part of the COVID-19 crisis response and recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cal-ITP also supports the state’s longer-term equity, economic development, and climate goals as delineated in
      <a
        rel="noreferrer"

        >2020 California Executive Order N-79-20</a
      >. Increased transit ridership is a key component of California’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat
      climate change. To reach its full potential, Cal-ITP will provide individual transit providers with the buying power to save
      on the equipment needed to ensure that transit remains a core tenet of the state’s mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As California faces these unprecedented challenges, there is a sense of urgency around creating a seamless, simpler, and
      more sustainable transit experience in California. Collaboration and collective problem-solving are needed at all levels of
      government, public and private transit providers, academia, and think tanks, as well as vendors of relevant technologies and
      business models. Join us.
