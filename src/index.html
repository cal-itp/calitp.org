    <h2>Bringing industry standards to California’s transit providers</h2>
    <p class="important">
      There are hundreds of public transit providers in California—with no single system for collecting fares, verifying
      eligibility for fare discounts, or providing up-to-date vehicle arrival information to riders.
    </p>
    <p class="important">
      This lack of uniformity creates barriers for new riders, complicates travel across different systems, and increases expenses
      for individual providers.

      cost-effective for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>Since forming in 2018, some Cal-ITP milestones include:</p>

    <h2>Identifying solutions</h2>
    <p>
      In August 2019, CalSTA and Caltrans organized a market sounding kickoff with companies and organizations in the payments,
      banking, and trip-planning industries. In that meeting, barriers to seamless trip planning and fare payment were identified,
      such as the lack of uniformity among California’s transit providers. Cal-ITP’s
      <a
        rel="noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        class="purple-link"
        href="https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/cal-itp/documents/final-cal-itp-market-sounding-market-response-summary-103119b-a11y.pdf"
        >1st Market Sounding</a
      >
      in October 2019 dug into these barriers and identified specific opportunities for Cal-ITP to assist California’s transit
      providers by leveraging global standards for data and payment systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding feasibility</h2>
    <p>
      Following the market sounding, Cal-ITP conducted a more thorough analysis to assess the financial and economic impacts of
      the recommended initiatives. The April 2020

      >
      details the state of public transit in California and quantifies the economic benefits of Cal-ITP’s three primary
      initiatives under conservative to moderate assumptions of project costs and ridership effects based on estimated demand.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting to work</h2>
    <p>
      To increase the quality and quantity of transit data published by California's transit providers, Cal-ITP and state and
      regional partners explored passenger-counting technologies in July 2020. Passenger occupancy data is crucial for
      transportation planning purposes, and physical distancing due to COVID-19 has highlighted the benefit for riders to know
      real-time passenger crowding in trip planning. Cal-ITP’s

        >2nd Market Sounding: Real-Time Transit Vehicle Occupancy Report</a
      >
      was published in October 2020.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020, Cal-ITP and partners gathered input from marketplace companies to gauge capabilities and interest in supporting
      payment issuance. The findings were documented in Cal-ITP’s

      and led to Cal-ITP collaborating with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2021 to understand the market for
      mobility accounts. Highlights from interviews with companies, transit agencies, and nonprofit and academic stakeholders can

        >new open data standard</a
      >
      to improve transit agency operations and promote an interoperable transit ecosystem by improving the flow of data and
      information sharing. The Operational Data Standard (ODS) leverages the existing GTFS standard used by transit agencies and
      riders all over the world for transit service information and extends it to include data about personnel, scheduled
      maintenance, and non-revenue service. The ODS specification is a product of the Operational Data Standard Working Group, a
      coalition of more than 40 transit agencies, transit technology vendors such as computer-aided dispatch/automatic vehicle
      location (CAD/AVL) companies, transit scheduling companies, and other contributors.

          >
          A simple, digitized, statewide verification program will enable any rider to have their eligibility for a reduced-fare
          program instantly verified for any transit provider in California. This way, older adults, students, veterans, and
          others can ride transit anywhere in the state with the confidence that they’ll be charged the right fare every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fare capping reduces transit costs for low-income riders.</strong> Unlimited-ride passes cost more upfront,
          forcing many riders to pay as they go at full fare. Contactless fare collection enables “fare capping,” which allows
          riders to pay the unlimited-ride price over time. This means that, after tapping enough times to reach the cost of a
          daily, weekly, or monthly pass, riders will no longer be charged for transit use for the remainder of that time period.

    <p>This initiative is critical now more than ever.</p>
    <p>
      As COVID-19 hit the United States, many transit providers saw ridership decrease. But many who depend on transit do not have
      the privilege to work from home—including many essential workers. Reliable transit access and contactless payments are
      critical components to ensuring that transit forms a key part of the COVID-19 crisis response and recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cal-ITP also supports the state’s longer-term equity, economic development, and climate goals as delineated in

        >2020 California Executive Order N-79-20</a
      >. Increased transit ridership is a key component of California’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat
      climate change. To reach its full potential, Cal-ITP will provide individual transit providers with the buying power to save
      on the equipment needed to ensure that transit remains a core tenet of the state’s mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As California faces these unprecedented challenges, there is a sense of urgency around creating a seamless, simpler, and
      more sustainable transit experience in California. Collaboration and collective problem-solving are needed at all levels of
      government, public and private transit providers, academia, and think tanks, as well as vendors of relevant technologies and
      business models. Join us.
