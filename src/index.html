        <h3>Enabling contactless payments</h3>
        <p>
          Adding a contactless payment reader to a bus or train means customers can quickly and easily tap to pay as they board
          with the bank card or smartphone that’s already in their pocket—just like they’d tap to buy a coffee.
        </p>

            target="_blank"
            >Monterey-Salinas Transit</a
          >, Cal-ITP and partners like Visa are demonstrating how a transit provider that has traditionally used cash and
          agency-specific fare cards can accept contactless bank card payments like any other merchant.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to make it easier and more affordable for public transportation providers anywhere in the U.S. to acquire the
          building blocks of contactless payments, the California Department of General Services (DGS)—in collaboration with
          Cal-ITP—conducted a Request for Proposal that established Master Service Agreements (MSAs) allowing public
          transportation providers to purchase contactless payments hardware and software directly from vendors without further
          competitive bidding. Learn about the MSAs in our
          <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Contactless.Payments.MSA.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.camobilitymarketplace.org/contracts" target="_blank">view the MSAs</a>.

        <h3>Standardizing information for easy trip planning</h3>

          Cal-ITP is helping transit providers remove the guesswork for riders wondering when the next bus or train will arrive or
          if they’ll make their connection by using the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)—the global standard for
          publishing transit information. Cal-ITP developed

            >California Minimum GTFS Guidelines</a
          >
          and is working to ensure statewide GTFS static coverage by the end of 2020 and GTFS Realtime by the end of 2021. Along
          the way, the Cal-ITP team will support transit providers by assessing their systems and providing technical assistance
          so riders can easily access complete, accurate, consistent, and timely mobility data for their journey.

  <h2>Bringing industry standards to California’s transit providers</h2>
  <p>
    There are hundreds of public transit providers in California—with no consistent way to collect fares, verify eligibility for
    fare discounts, or provide real-time vehicle information to customers on their phones.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lack of a consistent experience creates barriers for new customers, complicates travel across different systems, and
    increases expenses for individual providers.
