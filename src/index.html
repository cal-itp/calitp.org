        <h3>Enabling contactless payments</h3>
        <p>
          Adding a contactless payment reader to a bus or train means customers can quickly and easily tap to pay as they board
          with the bank card or smartphone that’s already in their pocket—just like they’d tap to buy a coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with

            rel="noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            >Monterey-Salinas Transit</a
          >, Cal-ITP and partners like Visa are demonstrating how a transit provider that has traditionally used cash and
          agency-specific fare cards can accept contactless bank card payments like any other merchant.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to make it easier and more affordable for public transportation providers anywhere in the U.S. to acquire the
          building blocks of contactless payments, the California Department of General Services (DGS)—in collaboration with
          Cal-ITP—conducted a Request for Proposal that established Master Service Agreements (MSAs) allowing public
          transportation providers to purchase contactless payments hardware and software directly from vendors without further
          competitive bidding. Learn about the MSAs in our
          <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Contactless.Payments.MSA.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a>, and

        <h3>Standardizing information for easy trip planning</h3>

          Cal-ITP is helping transit providers remove the guesswork for riders wondering when the next bus or train will arrive or
          if they’ll make their connection by using the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)—the global standard for
          publishing transit information. Cal-ITP developed

          >
          and is working to ensure statewide GTFS static coverage by the end of 2020 and GTFS Realtime by the end of 2021. Along
          the way, the Cal-ITP team will support transit providers by assessing their systems and providing technical assistance
          so riders can easily access complete, accurate, consistent, and timely mobility data for their journey.

  <h2>Bringing industry standards to California’s transit providers</h2>
  <p class="important">
    There are hundreds of public transit providers in California—with no single system for collecting fares, verifying eligibility
    for fare discounts, or providing up-to-date vehicle arrival information to riders.
  </p>
  <p class="important">
    This lack of uniformity creates barriers for new riders, complicates travel across different systems, and increases expenses
    for individual providers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supported by the
    <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="red-link" href="https://calsta.ca.gov/">California State Transportation Agency</a>
    (CalSTA) and the

  </p>
  <p>Since forming in 2018, some Cal-ITP milestones include:</p>

  <h2>Identifying solutions</h2>
  <p>
    In August 2019, CalSTA and Caltrans organized a market sounding kickoff with companies and organizations in the payments,
    banking, and trip-planning industries. In that meeting, barriers to seamless trip planning and fare payment were identified,
    such as the lack of uniformity among California’s transit providers. Cal-ITP’s

      class="purple-link"

      >1st Market Sounding</a
    >
    in October 2019 dug into these barriers and identified specific opportunities for Cal-ITP to assist California’s transit
    providers by leveraging global standards for data and payment systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding feasibility</h2>
  <p>
    Following the market sounding, Cal-ITP conducted a more thorough analysis to assess the financial and economic impacts of the
    recommended initiatives. The April 2020

    >
    details the state of public transit in California and quantifies the economic benefits of Cal-ITP’s three primary initiatives
    under conservative to moderate assumptions of project costs and ridership effects based on estimated demand.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting to work</h2>
  <p>
    To increase the quality and quantity of transit data published by California's transit providers, Cal-ITP and state and
    regional partners explored passenger-counting technologies in July 2020. Passenger occupancy data is crucial for
    transportation planning purposes, and physical distancing due to COVID-19 has highlighted the benefit for riders to know
    real-time passenger crowding in trip planning. Cal-ITP’s

      >2nd Market Sounding: Real-Time Transit Vehicle Occupancy Report</a
    >
    was published in October 2020.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2020, Cal-ITP and partners gathered input from marketplace companies to gauge capabilities and interest in supporting
    payment issuance. The findings were documented in Cal-ITP’s

      >3rd Market Sounding Report: Payment Issuance for California Transit</a

    and led to Cal-ITP collaborating with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2021 to understand the market for mobility
    accounts. Highlights from interviews with companies, transit agencies, and nonprofit and academic stakeholders can be found in

    to improve transit agency operations and promote an interoperable transit ecosystem by improving the flow of data and
    information sharing. The Operational Data Standard (ODS) leverages the existing GTFS standard used by transit agencies and
    riders all over the world for transit service information and extends it to include data about personnel, scheduled
    maintenance, and non-revenue service. The ODS specification is a product of the Operational Data Standard Working Group, a
    coalition of more than 40 transit agencies, transit technology vendors such as computer-aided dispatch/automatic vehicle
    location (CAD/AVL) companies, transit scheduling companies, and other contributors.

    <p>This initiative is critical now more than ever.</p>
    <p>
      As COVID-19 hit the United States, many transit providers saw ridership decrease. But many who depend on transit do not have
      the privilege to work from home—including many essential workers. Reliable transit access and contactless payments are
      critical components to ensuring that transit forms a key part of the COVID-19 crisis response and recovery.

      Cal-ITP also supports the state’s longer-term equity, economic development, and climate goals as delineated in

        >2020 California Executive Order N-79-20</a
      >. Increased transit ridership is a key component of California’s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat
      climate change. To reach its full potential, Cal-ITP will provide individual transit providers with the buying power to save
      on the equipment needed to ensure that transit remains a core tenet of the state’s mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As California faces these unprecedented challenges, there is a sense of urgency around creating a seamless, simpler, and
      more sustainable transit experience in California. Collaboration and collective problem-solving are needed at all levels of
      government, public and private transit providers, academia, and think tanks, as well as vendors of relevant technologies and
      business models. Join us.
