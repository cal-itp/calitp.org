  Fare Payment System

  Coast RTA leverages California’s approved vendors for a modern fare system that accepts riders’ mobile wallets and bank

intro: |-
  With its rollout of contactless payment acceptance devices aboard its bus fleet, South Carolina’s Coast RTA is the first
  public transit agency from another state to use the State of California’s competitively priced contracts to purchase and
  install the hardware and software services needed for accepting customers’ debit and credit cards and mobile wallets for fare
  payments.

Cal-ITP—Caltrans’ California Integrated Travel Project—supported Coast RTA through the process of purchasing open-loop payment
acceptance devices and fare calculation software from the State of California’s competitively awarded
[Master Service Agreements](https://www.calitp.org/assets/Contactless.Payments.MSA.pdf?utm_source=Coast+RTA+Press+Release&utm_medium=pr+email+social) (MSAs),
contracts that allow U.S. transit agencies to purchase hardware and software services directly from vendors without further
competitive bidding.

“California’s MSAs make it easier and more affordable for public transportation providers anywhere in the U.S. to acquire the
tools that allow riders to buy a bus ride the same way that they buy their groceries or a cup of coffee: with the credit or
debit card or mobile device that’s already in their pocket or on their wrist,” says Gillian Gillett, Caltrans’ California
Integrated Mobility Program Manager. Gillett leads [Cal-ITP](https://www.calitp.org/?utm_source=Coast+RTA+Press+Release&utm_medium=pr+email+social),
a California-based initiative to make riding by bus and rail simpler and more costeffective—for public transportation providers
and riders—by standardizing trip-planning information and modernizing fare collection systems.

“California’s contracts enabled us to purchase contactless open-loop payment acceptance devices and fare calculation
software—without having to conduct an RFP of our own or work through a lengthy procurement process,” says Brian Piascik,
General Manager and CEO of Coast RTA, which serves the Myrtle Beach resort town and nearby communities. “From reaching out to
Cal-ITP about using its state contracts to completing contracting and installation took just six months.”

In switching to contactless fares, Coast RTA launched a Tap to Cap program: Customers are charged $1 per bus ride, and fare
payments by bank card or mobile wallet are “capped” at $3.50 per day—riders tap to pay until they reach that daily maximum,
then ride for free the rest of the day when tapping with the same contactless payment method.

“Within days of launching our new fare payment system,” Piascik adds, “we could see that 15% of riders had already switched to
contactless to take advantage of Tap to Cap, which lets them pay as they go instead of locking up their money in a prepaid
farecard.”

Because a large percentage of Coast RTA’s rider base was paying in cash before the transition to a contactless system, Cal-ITP
worked with the transit agency and Visa to ensure that anyone, including riders who may be unbanked (no bank account) or
underbanked (not regularly using checks or debit/credit cards for purchases), can order the
[Cash App Card](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/3080-cash-card-get-started), a free contactless-enabled Visa debit card provided
by Cash App.

“Visa previously partnered with Cal-ITP to expand financial inclusion when contactless fare payments were launched in
California on Monterey-Salinas Transit and Sacramento Regional Transit District light rail,” says Julie Scharff, VP of U.S.
Card Present & Strategic Initiatives at Visa. “We’re pleased to also help riders in South Carolina gain access to a payment
option that works both on and off the bus—making paying for transit as easy as paying for other everyday essentials.”

The Cash App Card is a free, customizable debit card that is connected to your Cash App balance. It can be used anywhere Visa
is accepted. The Cash App Card can be used immediately, both online or in stores using a mobile wallet, before the physical
card arrives by mail. Cash App users have multiple ways to load funds to their Cash App balance, including by [depositing paper
money](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6488-paper-money-deposits) at various national and regional retailers, such as Walmart,
Walgreens, 7-Eleven, Rite Aid, and more.

Coast RTA purchased payment acceptance devices manufactured by Kuba Inc., one of the hardware vendors awarded an MSA by the
California Department of General Services (DGS), contracts that are available via Cal-ITP’s [California Mobility Marketplace](https://www.camobilitymarketplace.org/contracts?utm_source=Coast+RTA+Press+Release&utm_medium=pr+email+social).
Kuba, a global leader in fare payment systems, installed and implemented Coast RTA’s new system within 90 days of contract
signing.

“This is a testament to the partnership with Cal-ITP’s Mobility Marketplace,” says Kuba GM Brian Frank. “The successful and
timely collaboration between Coast RTA and our partners is a great example to other agencies of how easy implementing a modern
fare system can be, no matter the size of the agency.”

For transit processor services—the fare calculation software that enables pay-as-you-go fare capping like Coast RTA’s Tap to
Cap daily max fare—the transit agency contracted with Littlepay.

“Our platform is already pre-integrated with validators and acquirers available via CalITP’s Mobility Marketplace, so we can
plug-and-play a system within two months,” says Paul Griffin, Global Head of Commercial at Littlepay. “Agencies that choose
Littlepay do so safe in the knowledge that everything works already. There are no surprises, delays or costs to integrate
acquirers or devices.”

And for payment processing—the secure back-end service that transmits fares from riders’ tapped bank cards and smart devices
to transit providers’ bank accounts—Coast RTA contracted with Elavon, a company with which the State of California has an MSA
for Electronic Payment Acceptance Services (EPAY) for California-based government agencies; Elavon matched California’s EPAY
rates for Coast RTA.

“Our Mass Transit Payments product removes the need for specific transit agency–supported contactless cards by accepting any
contactless-enabled card or mobile device,” says Pari Sawant, Global Chief Product Officer of Elavon. “This helps to lower the
cost of payments acceptance and management for transit agencies and brings the ‘any card, anywhere’ approach to enable
contactless payments.”

Cybersource, a Visa solution, serves as both the gateway and payment management platform for Mass Transit Payments.

### Cal-ITP

The California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) was established by the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) and
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to both improve and encourage the use of multimodal travel throughout
California—by enabling contactless open-loop payments, standardizing information for easy multimodal trip planning, and
automating customer discounts ([Cal-ITP Benefits]({% link _press/cal-itp-benefits-launch.md %})). Over the past year, Cal-ITP
successfully led contactless open-loop contactless payment implementations in California on Monterey-Salinas and Santa Barbara
buses; Sacramento light rail; on-demand van ride service in San Diego; and LAX’s FlyAway bus, which connects airport passengers
to commuter rail.
