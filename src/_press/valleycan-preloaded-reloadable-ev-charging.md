Funded by the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz),
this nine-month Universal ZEV (Zero-Emission Vehicle) Equity Charging Card demonstration
project plans to increase equitable access to EV charging stations and help remove barriers to
EV ownership while building off the efforts of Valley CAN, a non-profit organization that works to
improve air quality and quality of life in disadvantaged communities in the San Joaquin Valley,
stretching from Lodi to Bakersfield.

“Valley CAN is committed to reducing carbon emissions in our region, which has some of the
worst air quality in the United States,” says Tom Knox, Executive Director of Valley CAN. “We
know the average EV driver saves money by driving electric, from lower fuel costs to lower
repair and maintenance costs. But not everyone can install a charging station at home. Helping
our EV-owning low-income residents access the public EV charging infrastructure with a prepaid
contactless debit card is an equitable way to ensure the success of Drive Clean in the San
Joaquin and Clean Cars 4 All.”

The initial participants purchased their EV through the Valley Air District’s [Drive Clean in the
San Joaquin](https://ww2.valleyair.org/grants/drive-clean-in-the-san-joaquin/) vehicle replacement program and qualify for the state’s $1,000 EV public charging
credit—funds that could be used for installing a residential charger or for using public charging
stations, but only if a participant has a contactless bank card that works at any charging station.
Valley CAN is sending each participant a Mastercard debit card—preloaded with $50 in
charging credit—issued by Prepaid Technologies. Each card is reloaded with an additional $50
per week, up to a total of $1,000 in benefits, and carries a maximum balance of $250 at any
time.

“The Universal ZEV Equity Charging Card demonstration project bridges the equity gap,
enabling participants to have more choice and convenience in how they receive their state
benefits as an EV owner,” says Gia Vacin, Assistant Deputy Director of ZEV Market
Development with GO-Biz. “Each EV helps us reach the state’s goals of 5 million ZEVs on
California roads by 2030 and 100% of new cars sales by 2035; a healthy, equitable used ZEV
market is also key to achieving these.”

As the implementing agency of the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB’s) successful Clean
Cars 4 All initiative to take older gas-powered vehicles off the road, the Valley Air District works
with program administrator Valley CAN to match low-income residents with up to $9,500 toward
the purchase of a used plug-in battery electric vehicle (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
(PHEV). To qualify for Clean Cars for All, an applicant’s household income must be at or below
400% of federal poverty level.

Drive Clean in the San Joaquin is one program under the state’s Clean Cars 4 All program.
Clean Cars 4 All is part of California Climate Investments, a statewide initiative that puts billions
of cap-and-trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the
economy and improving public health and the environment, and providing meaningful benefits to
the most disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, and low-income households.
Caltrans’ California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP)—a statewide initiative to ensure that all
Californians have access to mobility options and a contactless open-loop way to pay for them
using a credit or debit card or mobile wallet—serves as project manager for this demonstration,
having successfully led contactless open-loop payment demonstrations with public transit
agencies in Monterey-Salinas, Sacramento, and Santa Barbara County.

The contactless debit cards help fill a gap for the more than a quarter of Californians who do not
have a bank account (unbanked) or do not regularly use checks, debit, or credit cards for
purchases (underbanked)—and would have no easy way to pay at EV charging stations. In
2019, 7% of California residents were estimated to be unbanked and 19% were estimated to be
underbanked, statistics that mirror the national average of 25% of U.S. residents being
unbanked or underbanked. Cal-ITP has been developing an approach to providing payment
accounts to underbanked and unbanked Californians, effectively using the need to pay for EV
charging as well as public transit as a catalyst for addressing financial inclusion in low-income
and other target communities.

“As the state transitions to more secure contactless payment technologies, it is important that
access and support during this transition is equitable. Our goal is to unlock this market, helping
set the standard that contactless bank cards can be the payment method for all, including 10.3
million unbanked and underbanked California residents,” says Caltrans California Integrated
Mobility Program Manager Gillian Gillett, who leads Cal-ITP. “The demand and the need are
evident, and we’re excited to be working with payment solutions program managers and
financial services companies to meet these needs for all Californians.”

“At Prepaid Technologies, we’re focused on helping our customers solve their payments
challenges,” said Stephen Faust, CEO, Prepaid Technologies. “We’re proud to partner with
Mastercard to provide Valley CAN a financially inclusive, contactless payment solution for these
EV owners.”

Funding for this project is a part of the state’s $5 million investment from the 2021–’22 budget
meant to accelerate implementation of the ZEV Market Development Strategy, which focuses
on increasing awareness and access to ZEVs in the hardest to reach communities and
expanding tools that help convert this awareness into decisions to drive or ride in ZEVs. In total,
California is investing more than $10 billon to expand ZEV access and affordability and support
the build-out of infrastructure across the state.
