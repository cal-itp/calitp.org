      The Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC) supports several transit agencies in greater Ventura County and manages
      two. With a goal of unifying and modernizing transit in their region, VCTC partnered with Cal-ITP. They wanted to pilot
      scheduling software that could help them adjust existing routes, plan for the addition of electric vehicles, make quick and
      efficient schedule changes, and export high-quality GTFS (as required by the National Transit Database). In addition,
      Cal-ITP helped VCTC to better understand integrations between their technology vendors, to work to implement open loop
      payments on their VCTC Intercity service and to identify opportunities to streamline GTFS processes.
