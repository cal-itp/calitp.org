        The California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP) is working with transit agencies across the state (and country!) to
        promote a modern and consistent transportation experience throughout California. Each and every transit agency in the
        state can become a Cal-ITP customer. We provide free technical assistance and support to help agencies implement
        Contactless Payments, Transit Benefits, GTFS and more.

      The Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC) supports several transit agencies in greater Ventura County and manages
      two. With a goal of unifying and modernizing transit in their region, VCTC partnered with Cal-ITP. They wanted to pilot
      scheduling software that could help them adjust existing routes, plan for the addition of electric vehicles, make quick and
      efficient schedule changes, and export high-quality GTFS (as required by the National Transit Database). In addition,
      Cal-ITP helped VCTC to better understand integrations between their technology vendors, to work to implement open loop
      payments on their VCTC Intercity service and to identify opportunities to streamline GTFS processes.

      Glenn County is a small agency with big goals to improve the rider experience  through contactless payments. They are
      working with their Cal-ITP account manager and a team of Cal-ITP payments specialists to plan the project and prepare for
      implementation. The Cal-ITP team’s role includes guiding the agency through scoping their requirements; making use of the
      State of California Master Service Agreements; and providing support with rider marketing and communications. This dedicated
      support is designed to help Glenn County make informed decisions, meet their deadlines, and set them up for a successful
      contactless payments launch.

        appreciated.”

    <h3>Monterey-Salinas Transit</h3>
    <ul class="mt-3">
      <li>Fleet size: 88</li>
      <li>Services operated: fixed-route, paratransit</li>
      <li>
        Goals:
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce cash dependency</li>
          <li>Implement contactless payments for all riders</li>
          <li>Streamline eligibility verification for discounts</li>
          <li>Improve connectivity in rural areas</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-3">
      After implementing contactless payments, Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) needed a way to help their riders quickly and easily
      access transit benefits and discounts. They wanted a minimalist, seamless solution. They wanted riders to be able to use
      their benefits without downloading a new app or device.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Cal-ITP partnered with MST to review existing fare policies, including for federally required groups like veterans and older
      adults. MST implemented Cal-ITP Benefits, an automated process which allows riders to link their transit discount to their
      card for contactless payment. Digitally verifying identification reduced the burden on the customer service team at MST, who
      previously processed all applications by hand.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      In 2022, MST became the first transit agency in the nation to provide an automated method for Senior Citizen Discounts via
      an open-loop contactless payment system. In the past year, 200% more riders have tapped to pay and received their discounted
      fare automatically!
